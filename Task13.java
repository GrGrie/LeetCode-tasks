/*
    Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
    I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
    X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
    C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
    Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

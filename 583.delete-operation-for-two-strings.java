         * Leetcode Daily Challenge 14.06.2022. I think the solution is as follows:
         * I have to find the longest substring, that contain both word1 and word2,
         * then return word1.length-subtring.length + word2.length-substring.lengthÑŽ
         * After around whole day of trying different things I went to solution, to 
         * find, that O(n^2) is the first thing I should have tried and there is a 
         * way to make it better (memorisation) :(
